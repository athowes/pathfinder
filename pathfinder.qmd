## Why are we interested in this?

* We have probabilistic models that we would like to perform Bayesian inference for
* We routinely fit 100s of models, and require reliable methods
* For complex models or large data, MCMC and HMC can be impractical
* Alternatively, MCMC and HMC require good initialisation values (burn-in)

## Features of pathfinder

* Claimed "state-of-the-art" method for black box VI and MCMC burn-in
* Fast (-er than ADVI and HMC) and (almost embarrasingly) parallelisable
* Robust to "varying curvature, minor multimodality, avoiding variance and non-convergence of SGD"
* A little more accurate (than?)

## Implementation

* Implemented in Stan
* Stan also has Laplace, ADVI, HMC
* Can operate as a easy replacement for HMC in `EpiNow2`, `epinowcast`, and `epidist`

## Comparison for `epidist`

* I've been working on a vignette for `epidist` demonstrating Laplace, ADVI, pathfinder, and HMC
